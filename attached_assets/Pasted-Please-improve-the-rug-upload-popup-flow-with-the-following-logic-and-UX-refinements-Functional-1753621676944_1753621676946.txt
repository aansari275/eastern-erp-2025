Please improve the rug upload popup flow with the following logic and UX refinements:

üß© Functional Requirements
Unit Toggle

Add a toggle or dropdown to switch between Centimeters and Feet.

Default to Centimeters.

If the user switches units, convert the values accordingly.

Shape Selection

Let user choose shape: Rectangle, Square, Round, Runner.

Shape affects which size fields are editable:

Rectangle and Runner: width and height are editable.

Square and Round: lock width = height. Only one input is shown.

Automatically update the canvas size and shape when a selection is made.

Canvas Binding

The selected size and shape should reflect directly on the main canvas. If user selects 150x220cm Rectangle, canvas updates instantly to that ratio.

Image Upload

Keep one single unified button: Upload Rug Design.

Once image is uploaded:

Show a preview or thumbnail

Auto-start vectorization (or allow a follow-up "Vectorize" click)

Place the vector on canvas centered and scaled properly (not cropped or misaligned)

Let‚Äôs Go Button

Add a clear ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go‚Äù or ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù button in the popup after all options are selected.

Clicking this:

Closes the popup

Places the rug on canvas

Begins vectorization or next step

Disable Redundant Buttons

Remove all extra buttons like Upload, Upload & Vectorize, Vectorize, etc.

Just one clear action based on the flow described above.

üé® Optional: Figma-like Animation & Microinteractions (UI Polish)
Use Tailwind transitions or Framer Motion to:

Animate Shape Picker

Add active state animations (highlighting / background pill slide).

Auto-lock Inputs

Animate height field fading out when Square or Round selected.

Unit Switch

Smoothly convert values when toggling between cm/ft (with easing).

Let‚Äôs Go Button

Hover scale effect (scale: 1.05)

Loading state after click (spinner or ‚ÄúUploading‚Ä¶‚Äù)

Disable if no image or dimensions selected.

Modal Animation

Fade in + scale up modal when it opens

Fade out cleanly on close or submit

Upload Preview

Show image preview thumbnail with smooth slide-in animation
